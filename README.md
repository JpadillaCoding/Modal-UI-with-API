### Nasa Image API search engine
Using Nasa's Image and Video Library API, I made a search engine. The API has 4 endpoints- Search, Asset, Metadata, and Captions. Under Search, there are also further options for Images, Videos, and Audio. I chose to stick to using only Search since I wanted this to be an engine showcasing only Images. This project helped me practice fetching data from an API, reading documentation, state control, and also usage of pagination. 

## Project progression 
My Initial plan was just to use data from one search and display a portion of the data retrieved. After I got my initial plan complete, I decided to challenge myself a bit by making a search function for the user to be able to retrieve any image on Nasa's database. Once this was complete, pagination was made so the user wouldn't need to scroll so much and add a better user experience.
